#Message Model: 
The code assumes a simple message model where a message can have a variable number of headers and a binary payload. 
Headers consist of name-value pairs, and both names and values are encoded as ASCII strings. 
Header names and values are limited to a maximum of 1023 bytes each. The message can have a maximum of 63 headers, and the payload is 
limited to a maximum of 256 KiB (256 * 1024 bytes).

#Binary Message Encoding: 
The encoding scheme converts the message into binary data before transmitting it. The binary format is used to ensure that the message 
can be efficiently transmitted and reconstructed by computers.

#Text Encoding: 
The TextEncoder and TextDecoder classes are used for text-to-binary and binary-to-text conversions, respectively. 
It is assumed that these classes are supported by the JavaScript environment or a polyfill is provided for environments that do not support them.

#Uint8Array and DataView: 
The code makes use of Uint8Array and DataView to work with binary data and manipulate the bytes. It is assumed that these objects 
are supported by the JavaScript environment.

#Maximum Sizes: 
The code enforces maximum sizes for headers and payload to prevent excessively large messages. If a message exceeds the allowed sizes, 
the encoding process throws an error.

#Header Length Calculations: 
The code calculates the size of each header based on the lengths of the header name and value, and the required overhead for storing 
length information. It is assumed that the header name and value are encoded as ASCII strings with a one-byte-per-character representation.

#Error Handling: 
The code uses error throwing to handle exceptional cases, such as exceeding maximum sizes for headers and payload.

#No External Dependencies: 
The code is designed not to rely on any platform built-in or third-party serializer implementations, as specified by the requirements.
